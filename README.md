# drive-license-simulator-game

Thiis is my graduating project

The content of the thesis is about the description of design and development of a little videogame that was made using Unity3D as engine and C# as programming language. The purpose of the game is to simulate the driving of cars in common and realistic simulation. To teach/educate a safe drive and to manage decisions through gamification approach is the final goal of the game. Development took about three months and the workflow used is the waterfall model. Programming was made through adoption of objcet oriented programming patterns and universal standard. The tasks and contents of the project were split up by semantic areas, so that both during development and in the end of it, the project resulted modular. In the end the game was tested both on virtual and physical devices, in order to check performance, functionalities and correctness.
